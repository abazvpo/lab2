### About us
We investigate how language is represented and processed â€“ in particular, which traits of language representation and processing are universal and which vary depending on the particular specifications of each language.

### Research
1. *Language processing*.  We investigate how language is represented and processed in the bilingual mind. We examine Basque-Spanish and Spanish-Basque bilingual populations of different age of acquisition of the second language and of different proficiency levels. In our studies we use various experimental techniques: behavioral (i.e. reaction times) and electrophysiological measures such as Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) or eye-tracking.

2. *Linguistic variation and Corpus studies*. In order to study Basque / Spanish neurobilingualism, an investigation of the structure of Basque is required. Basque language is typologically different from its Indoeuropean neighbours, which are better known and studied. That is why another of the main objectives is to describe and analyze Basque in its synchronic dimension, especially focusing on its contemporaneous dialectal variations. To carry out both experimental and descriptive works a detailed linguistic analysis is required, especially corpus studies of lexical, morphological and syntactic frequencies as well as  their environment and the ways of variation.

<!---Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem in Neuroscience and beyond. We build algorithms to analyze data. We also use theory as well as computational and [neural modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) to understand how information is processed in the nervous system, explaining data obtained in collaboration with [electrophysiologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) and in [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) experiments. Lastly, we constrain and develop new technologies aimed at obtaining data about brains.--->


<!--- Our conceptual work addresses information processing in the nervous system from two angles: (1) By analyzing and explaining electrophysiological data, we study what neurons do. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior, we study what all these neurons do together. Much of our work looks at these questions from a normative or causal viewpoint, asking what problems the nervous system should be solving. This often means taking a Bayesian approach. Bayesian decision theory is the systematic way of calculating how the nervous system may make good decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Causal inference from observational data promises to be a key enabler for progress in science.--->
